ES6 Notes

1) let and const are block scoped
2) var is function scoped
3) const cannot be re-assigned, can update object properties. E.G person.age = 30;
4)	{
		const name = 'dan'; //works like IFFE, won't attach to window	
	}
5) const cannot hoist
6) Using arrow function inherits this from parent, don't have to worry about scope
7) Default functions arguments function (total, tax = 0.13, tip = 0.15)
